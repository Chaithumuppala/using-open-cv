Hand Gesture & Finger Detection using MediaPipe (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project uses MediaPipe HandLandmarker (Tasks API) and OpenCV to detect a human hand from a webcam and determine whether each finger (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky) is UP or DOWN in real time.

The system is designed to be accurate, stable, and industry-ready, even when the hand is slightly tilted or rotated.


🎯 Features

✅ Real-time hand detection using webcam

✅ Accurate finger UP/DOWN detection

✅ Supports all 5 fingers (Thumb included)

✅ Works for both Left and Right hands

✅ Robust against hand tilt and camera angle changes
